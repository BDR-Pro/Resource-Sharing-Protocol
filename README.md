# 🔗 RSP (Resource Sharing Protocol) — Colab Demo

This notebook demonstrates the core logic of **RSP**, a custom binary protocol for buying/selling virtual machines (VMs) securely.

### ✅ Features

- High-performance binary protocol (MessagePack + struct)
- Packet header format (8 bytes: CMD_ID, FLAGS, LENGTH, RESERVED)
- Secure VM access via SSH (simulated)
- Basic escrow logic with buyer/seller flow

---

## Header 
```
RSP_VER   : 1   → protocol version 1
VPN_FLAG  : 1   → tunneled through VPN
CMD_ID    : 1   → REQUEST_VM
FLAGS     : 6   → Encrypted + High Priority
BODY_LEN  : 48  → 0x0030 (big endian)
RESERVED  : 00 00 00 00
```

## 📦 Packet Format

```

\[CMD\_ID:1]\[FLAGS:1]\[BODY\_LEN:2]\[RESERVED:4]\[BODY:...]

````

- `CMD_ID=1` → `REQUEST_VM`
- `FLAGS=6`  → `Encrypted + High Priority`
- `BODY`     → MessagePack dict

---

## 🚀 Run in Colab

```python
!pip install msgpack
````

Then run the notebook cells to:

1. Construct and send RSP packets
2. Parse and print headers
3. Decode and inspect payloads

---

## 💡 Example Payload

```json
{
  "cpu": 2,
  "ram": 4,
  "duration": 60,
  "provider": "qemu"
}
```

---

## 🧠 Next Steps

* Add real SSH validation for VMs
* Integrate escrow logic
* Wrap in OpenVPN + TLS for secure communication
* Signature In-Body
* Session ID
* 🔐 Zero-Knowledge Proof field for spec validation

* 🛠 Command negotiation
* 📊 Usage telemetry *(client asks which VM providers are supported)*
